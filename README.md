Official program name: Grade Management System (GMS) for Motherboard University

Developed by: GROUP 4 (Bon Jovi, Sabrina Spellman, Sarah Connor)

Scope:
The “Grade Management System” is, at its core, a web-based application that allows students and teachers to view and input grades, respectively. The system allows grades to be arranged into several views available depending on their user type. The application requires no software downloads and can be used from any current major release web browser, on any platform.

The system will utilize a database of students, faculty members, class and enrollment information, and can be managed by a designated system administrator who will have elevated permissions (typically the institution’s registrar). The administrator can utilize the web portal to manage, verify, and keep accurate the system’s information. 

The system is intended to be used with an internet connection - with the database and the web portal hosted on a web-server. However, when necessary, the system can be migrated and implemented 
on a local network and preserve all primary functionality.
